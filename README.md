# NAME

Plack::Middleware::Antibot - Prevent bots from submitting forms

# SYNOPSIS

    use Plack::Builder;

    my $app = { ... };

    builder {
        enable 'Antibot', filters => [qw/FakeField TooFast/];
        $app;
    };

# DESCRIPTION

Plack::Middleware::Antibot is a [Plack](https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack) middleware that prevents bots from
submitting forms. Every filter implements its own checks, so see their
documentation.

Plack::Middleware::Antibot uses scoring system (0 to 1) to determine if the
client is a bot. Thus it can be configured to match any needs.

## `$env`

Some filters set additional `$env` keys all prefixed with `antibot.`. For
example `TextCaptcha` filter sets `antibot.text_captcha` to be shown to the
user.

## Options

### **max\_score**

When accumulated score reaches this amount, no more filters are run and bot is
detected. `0.8` by default.

### **filters**

    enable 'Antibot', filters => ['FakeField'];

To specify filter arguments instead of a filter name pass an array references:

    enable 'Antibot', filters => [['FakeField', field_name => 'my_fake_field']];

### **fall\_through**

    enable 'Antibot', filters => ['FakeField'], fall_through => 1;

Sometimes it is needed to process detected bot yourself. This way in case of
detection `$env`'s key `antibot.detected` will be set.
